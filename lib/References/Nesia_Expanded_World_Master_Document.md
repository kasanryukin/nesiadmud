# Nesia — Expanded World Master Document
*(Reference Edition — 2025-10-22)*

## Overview

Nesia is a high-fantasy world defined by its vast diversity of cultures, landscapes, and cosmological order. It spans multiple continents separated by deep oceans and polar glaciers, featuring thriving empires, wild frontiers, and ancient divine influences.

### Continents and Polar Regions
The world’s surface can be divided into three principal continental masses:
- **Western Continent** — A mountainous land of fjords and taiga, home to the **Empire of Fay** and **Grand Duchy of Roria**.
- **Central Continent** — A vast heartland of kingdoms and empires such as **Zarag**, **Umun**, and **Baram**, containing the most densely populated and politically complex regions.
- **Southern Continent** — Tropical to temperate climates dominated by **Chechia**, **Ovetsia**, and **Ika**, with high volcanic ridges and dense rainforest.

Polar regions are bound by ice sheets and tundra, forming the natural barriers of the **Far North** and **South Glaciers**.
