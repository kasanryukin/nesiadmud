The chamber’s walls are of dark \r\nbasalt veined with red-gold streaks, as though the stone itself remembers the \r\nfires that once birthed it.  Every surface gleams softly in the ethereal \r\nblue-white light that permeates the temple, yet in this room it takes on a \r\nwarmer hue, reflecting off metal fittings and the dull shine of iron tools \r\nresting in quiet display.\r\n\r\nAt the chamber’s heart stands a great ceremonial forge, its broad mouth \r\nshaped like a solemn altar.  Though no flame burns within it, faint orange \r\nlight glows deep in the coals, pulsing with the slow rhythm of the breath of a \r\ndivine fire that never truly dies.  A broad bellows rests nearby, its surface \r\ncarved with stylized hammers and radiant suns.  The faint scent of soot and oil\r\nlingers in the air, grounding the sanctity here in tangible craft.\r\n\r\nAround the forge, the floor bears concentric rings of inlaid brass, each etched\r\nwith patterns of tools, runes, and stylized flames, the symbols of those who \r\nonce offered their creations in faith.  The space feels alive with quiet \r\npotential, as if every tool, every spark, and every heartbeat waits for the \r\nnext act of making.  A single torch burns in an iron sconce next to the \r\nbellows.\r\n"
