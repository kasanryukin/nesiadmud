Every block, every line of mortar, every joint \r\nof stone seems placed with impossible precision as though measured by a hand \r\nthat understood perfection itself.  The air is cool and utterly still, the \r\nfaint blue-white light settling evenly across every surface without shadow or \r\ndistortion.  The floor forms a seamless pattern of interlocking geometric \r\ntiles, circles within squares, triangles nested within arcs, each exact and \r\nmirrored flawlessly.\r\n\r\nA polished stone altar stands at the chamber’s center, its surface divided \r\ninto faint grids of silver inlay.  Upon it rests a single compass and square \r\nfashioned from white gold, their points forever joined in balance.  When the \r\nlight strikes them, fine motes shimmer outward, tracing ephemeral runes in the \r\nair that fade almost before the eye can follow.\r\n\r\nAlong the walls, faint lines of script wind in a continuous band, carved so \r\nshallowly that they seem part of the stone’s grain.  The language is ancient \r\nand precise, a hymn of measure and symmetry, yet even without comprehension its\r\nrhythm carries a deep calm as though one’s very thoughts fall into order \r\nmerely by standing here.  A small recess nearby holds a box of small candles.\r\n"
