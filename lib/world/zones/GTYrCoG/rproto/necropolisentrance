The air here is still heavier, touched with the mineral \r\nscent of deep stone and the quiet gravity of what lies below.\r\n\r\nThe passage opens into a modest, square chamber whose purpose feels both sacred\r\nand practical.  The ceiling lowers slightly, supported by plain arches of \r\nunadorned granite.  The floor bears no sigils or ornamentation, only a single \r\ncircular mosaic of black and white stone.\r\n\r\nA wide stairway descends into darkness, its steps worn smooth by centuries of \r\nprocessions.  Each torch along the walls burns a little lower than the last, \r\nguiding the way down to the Necropolis of Yttribus.  To the south, the faint \r\nblue-white glow of the All Mother’s chapel beckons, distant yet comforting, a\r\nreminder of the light that endures above.\r\n"
