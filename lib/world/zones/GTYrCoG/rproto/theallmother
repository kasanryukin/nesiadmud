Every surface glows with a faint bluish-white \r\nradiance, neither torchlight nor spellcraft, but something deeper, the breath \r\nof divinity woven into the walls themselves.  The air is still and cool, \r\ncarrying a quiet hum that resonates through the bones, as though the chamber \r\nitself were alive and listening.\r\n\r\nA wide stairway of polished marble rises at the northern end, its steps leading\r\nup to a large landing and a narrow corridor that continues farther north.\r\nAround the chamber’s circumference, five arched passages open toward the \r\ngreater chapels, each distinct, yet balanced.\r\n\r\nTo the south, the archway bears the mark of the Forge, its frame carved in \r\ngentle reliefs of hammer and flame.  To the east, a line of inlaid silver forms\r\na compass and circle indicating the path of the Architect.  To the west, vines \r\nand curling tendrils adorn the arch of the Verdant, stone seeming to breathe \r\nwith life.  To the northwest, the smooth marble is veined with gold, shimmering\r\nfaintly as though kissed by the Luminar themself.  And to the northeast, \r\nshadows cling subtly to the stone, the air cooler and softer at the threshold \r\nof the Veil.\r\n\r\nAt the very center of the chamber stands a low dais of translucent crystal, \r\nfaint motes of light drifting within it like stars in deep water.  It is not an\r\naltar, but a point of stillness, the place where all divine paths converge, and\r\nwhere the All Mother’s presence feels closest.\r\n"
