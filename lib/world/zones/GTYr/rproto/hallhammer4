The air is \r\nthick with smoke and sparks, glowing motes that dance in the dim light like \r\nembers of divine favor.  Massive stone furnaces line the far wall, their iron \r\ndoors emblazoned with the sigil of The Hammer, a stylized hammer striking an \r\nanvil, sparks forming a radiant halo above it.  Channels in the floor carry \r\nrunoff from the quenching basins, steam hissing where molten droplets meet cool\r\nstone.  This is the heart of the orderâ€™s devotion, where faith is proven not \r\nin words, but in fire and sweat.  Every weapon, every plate, every link of mail\r\nis both tool and prayer, born from the forge, and consecrated by toil.\r\n"
