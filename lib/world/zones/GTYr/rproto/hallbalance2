Long oak tables bear the marks of years of use, their benches worn \r\nsmooth from countless meals and quiet discussions.  A hearth along the northern\r\nwall provides steady warmth, its mantle lined with modest steel cups and a few \r\ndented practice helms.  Shelves near the east wall hold ledgers, chessboards, \r\nand a scattering of dice.  Tools for both recreation and judgment.  A bulletin \r\nboard displays assignments, lost property notices, and a handful of \r\ncommendations pinned with brass tacks.  To the west, a short archway leads \r\nonward, while the landing lies back to the south.\r\n"
