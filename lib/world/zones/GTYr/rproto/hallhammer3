Wide stone benches are \r\nlittered with half-finished armor, bundles of wire, and blueprints drawn in \r\ncareful, square-handed script.  The smell of heated oil and ground metal hangs \r\nheavy in the air, mixing with the faint tang of coal dust from the adjoining \r\nforge.  Racks of chisels, tongs, and measuring tools line the walls, each in \r\nits proper placeâ€”a discipline as sacred as prayer to members of the order.  A\r\ncooling trough occupies the center of the room, its dark surface broken by the \r\noccasional hiss of quenching steel.  Here, novices learn precision before \r\nstrength; every strike of the hammer is an act of devotion, every flaw a \r\nreminder that even the devoted must be reforged.\r\n"
