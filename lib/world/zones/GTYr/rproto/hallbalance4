A broad oak desk dominates the center, its surface bare save for a \r\nquill set, an open ledger, and a neatly stacked pile of parchment bearing the \r\nOrder’s sigil,a balanced scale over a sword.  Two plain chairs face the desk,\r\ntheir wooden frames polished by frequent use.  The faint scent of wax and \r\nparchment lingers in the air, and a single lantern burns steadily on a wall \r\nhook, casting clean, even light.  A simple banner bearing the Order’s emblem \r\nhangs behind the desk, symbol of impartial service and unyielding duty.\r\n"
