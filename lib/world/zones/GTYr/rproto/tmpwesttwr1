The walls are \r\nadorned with intricate carvings and ornaments.  On the north side, the colors \r\nare predominantly steel grey and deep blue, with detailed patterns and motifs \r\nthat catch the light.  On the south side, the colors are deep crimson and \r\nburnished bronze, adding a rich and warm contrast to the cool tones on the \r\nother side.  The air is filled with a subtle, sacred atmosphere, hinting at the\r\ntemple's ancient and revered history.\r\n"
