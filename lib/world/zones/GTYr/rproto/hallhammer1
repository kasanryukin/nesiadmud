The commons is plain but \r\nsturdy, its stone floor worn smooth by boot and hammer alike.  Benches and \r\nheavy oak tables fill the space, scarred by generations of use and engraved \r\nwith runic prayers to The Hammer.  Walls are lined with racks of tools rather \r\nthan trophies, each lovingly maintained and precisely ordered.  A single banner\r\ndepicting a blazing anvil hangs over the hearth, its fabric stained by decades \r\nof forge smoke.  The room hums with quiet industry, even when no work is being \r\ndone; it is a place for food, fellowship, and the tempering of both metal and \r\nwill.\r\n"
