A sturdy desk rests near the far wall, stacked with ledgers and worn\r\nscrolls, while a lectern stands ready for study or sermon preparation.  A \r\nsimple cot occupies one corner, neatly made, its blanket plain but clean.\r\nBookshelves line the walls, filled with texts both sacred and practical, their \r\nspines faded with age.  Soft light spills from a wrought iron candelabra \r\nsuspended from the ceiling, joined by a handful of scattered candlesticks that \r\nilluminate reading and work spaces.  The air carries the faint scent of wax and\r\nold parchment.  Despite the roomâ€™s simplicity, it exudes a quiet authority, \r\nthe space of one accustomed to contemplation, administration, and devotion in \r\nequal measure.\r\n"
