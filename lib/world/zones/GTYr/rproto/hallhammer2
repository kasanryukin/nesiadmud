The\r\nair carries only a faint tang of smoke, the walls thick enough to mute the \r\nforge’s constant thunder.  Heavy shelves display masterworks of the order’s\r\ncraft, blades balanced to perfection, armor etched with scenes of divine labor,\r\nand hammers engraved with the names of their makers.  A broad desk of dark \r\nironwood dominates the center, its surface scarred from years of use rather \r\nthan neglect.  Behind it hangs a great circular emblem, half anvil and half \r\nrising sun, cast in burnished bronze.  Here the Forge Warden oversees \r\ncommissions, disputes, and initiations, guiding both apprentices and knights \r\nalike in the philosophy that to create is to serve, that a steady hand at the \r\nforge is as sacred as a steady hand in battle.\r\n"
