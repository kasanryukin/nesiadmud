  me.name       = "Hall of Worship - South"
  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "    The southern end of the great hall narrows into a quiet solemnity.  Massive\r\ndouble doors stand to the south, their weighty presence marking the temple’s \r\nthreshold with an air of finality.  To either side, broad corridors branch east\r\nand west, their archways framed in cool, pale stone.  The floor beneath the \r\ndoors is of marble, worn smooth by ages of passage, yet a great symbol still \r\nendures at its heart, its lines cut deep enough to defy time itself.\r\n"
  
  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("symbol, sigil", "    Carved deep into the marble floor lies a vast circular sigil, its grooves \r\nworn smooth yet unmistakably deliberate.  At its heart rests a radiant \r\nsun-disc, lines and rings etched in perfect symmetry, each ray a channel of \r\ndivine origin.  Around it stand five larger emblems, evenly spaced, their forms\r\ndistinct yet harmonious, each surrounded by three smaller runes that trace its \r\ninfluence.  Together they form a geometry of twenty-one, a covenant of unity \r\nand divine order.  Though time has dulled its edges, the seal still seems to \r\nthrum faintly beneath the stone, as if acknowledging every prayer spoken under \r\nthe All Mother’s gaze.\r\n")
