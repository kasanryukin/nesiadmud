The stone floor is \r\nworn smooth by disciplined boots, and banners of muted gold and gray hang \r\nbetween sconces that burn with steady, even flame.  A wooden desk sits near the\r\nwall, bearing quills, ledgers, and a single brass set of scales that are \r\nperfectly balanced.  To the north and west lie arched doorways, their lintels \r\ncarved with the sigil of the Balanced Scale, while a stairwell descends into \r\nshadow, the faint echo of footfalls rising from below.\r\n"
