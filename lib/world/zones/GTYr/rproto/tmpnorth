Vaulted arches rise overhead, \r\nsupported by immense stone columns carved with softened lines of ancient \r\nscript.  To the north, an archway leads deeper into the temple while to the \r\neast and west, narrower corridors branch away toward the templeâ€™s quieter \r\nreaches.  Farther south, the chamber expands into a sanctified hall aglow with \r\ncolor from tall stained-glass windows, each portraying a deity in light and \r\nreverence.  No torches burn here, the air itself seeming luminous and alive \r\nwith a pale steady radiance.  At the center stands an ornate pulpit of dark \r\nstone, its sigils glimmering faintly like the heartbeat of the temple itself.\r\n"
