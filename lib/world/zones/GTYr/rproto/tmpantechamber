The air here feels hushed and cool, carrying only \r\nthe faint crackle of torchlight from the sconces set between the doors ahead.\r\nThree doorways break the northern wall: a central door of dark oak, banded in \r\nbrass; to its left, a weathered ash door, pale and worn smooth by touch; to its\r\nright, a polished maple door, faintly gleaming in the firelight.  Each stands \r\nclosed and silent, lending the space an air of waiting.  To the south, the hall\r\nopens once more toward the pulpit and the sanctum beyond.\r\n"
