Each weapon bears a small \r\nbrass tag etched with a number, and missing slots are marked with chalk until \r\ntheir gear is returned.  A heavy workbench occupies the center of the room, \r\nscattered with whetstones, spare fittings, and the faint scent of oil and iron.\r\nSimple armor stands display the standard livery of the Order, unadorned steel \r\ntrimmed in muted blue.  A ledger rests open on a small desk near the entrance, \r\ncataloging issued arms and maintenance reports.\r\n"
