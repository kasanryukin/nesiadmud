  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("altar", "    The altar is broad and solid, hewn from a dark, grain-flecked stone that \r\nseems to drink in the light.  Its surface bears faint etchings smoothed by \r\nyears of ritual, yet the shape remains unbroken, unmoved by time.  A small \r\nwooden step ladder rests against one side, scuffed from frequent use by shorter\r\nattendants.  Standing near it, a subtle pressure builds behind the eyes, an \r\nalmost imperceptible hum that stirs the edge of thought, as if the altar \r\nremembers every offering ever laid upon it.\r\n")
  me.edesc("pillar, pillars", "    Each pillar rises in quiet reverence, worn smooth by wind and rain yet \r\nstill proud against the open sky.  Their carvings are intricate but aged, the \r\nmeanings softened into mystery by centuries of devotion.  Some bear faint \r\ntraces of gold leaf or pigment in the deeper grooves, hints of color long since\r\nsurrendered to time.  Together they form a silent circle around the altar, \r\ntheir shadows mingling across the stone floor like the memory of a \r\nlong-forgotten ritual.\r\n")
  me.edesc("step-ladder, ladder", "    Made of a study dark wood and framed in iron, these steps are showing their\r\nsigns of age from years of use by the shorter races in service to their \r\ndeities.\r\n")
