Tall columns rise to meet the vaulted \r\nceiling, where shifting light from the stained-glass windows dances across \r\nstone and wood alike.  The air hums faintly with the quiet weight of reverence,\r\ncolored by soft hues that drift as the light changes.  To the north, the pulpit\r\nstands in solemn command before the worship space; to the south the room \r\ncontinues toward the far end of the sanctum where a pair of massive double \r\ndoors marks the sanctumâ€™s far boundary, their surface dark and worn with age.\r\n"
