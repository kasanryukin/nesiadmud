The north wall is \r\nadorned with intricate relief carvings depicting a pair of scales balanced upon\r\na sword point, encircled by a laurel wreath.  This elegant and symbolic design \r\nis rendered in deep blue and steel grey, creating a striking visual effect.  On\r\nthe south wall, a stylized hammer striking an anvil is depicted, with sparks \r\nforming a radiant halo above it.  This side is adorned in deep crimson and \r\nburnished bronze, adding warmth and dynamism to the scene.  The air is filled \r\nwith a subtle, sacred atmosphere, hinting at the temple's ancient and revered \r\nhistory.\r\n"
