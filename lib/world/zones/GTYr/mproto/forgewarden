Her bronze-toned fur, once uniform, bears patches\r\nof scarred skin where the forge claimed its due.  She moves with deliberate \r\nconfidence, every motion efficient and practiced.  Her attire is simple, \r\nheat-darkened leathers, heavy gloves, and a soot-stained apron, yet her bearing\r\nis unmistakably that of one who leads.  A chain of blackened iron encircles her\r\nneck, from which hangs the insignia of the Order: a stylized hammer striking an\r\nanvil wreathed in radiant sparks.\r\n\r\nThough age has bent her slightly, her eyes still burn with the same inner fire \r\nas her forge.  She speaks plainly and expects the same in return; to those \r\nseeking the Order’s path, she offers neither comfort nor discouragement, only\r\nthe truth of iron: “You’ll break or you’ll be made stronger.  Either way,\r\nthe hammer falls.” \r\n"
