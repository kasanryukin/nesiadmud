Her robes are simple and\r\nwell-kept, woven from coarse fabric dyed the muted gray of temple stone, marked\r\nonly by a small pendant bearing the sigil of the pantheon.  Candlelight plays \r\nacross her sharp features and keen amber eyes, lending them a steady, \r\nthoughtful glow.  There is little ornament to her presence.  No jeweled rings \r\nor gilded hems, yet an unmistakable gravity surrounds her, the calm assurance \r\nof one who serves not through grandeur, but through steadfast purpose.\r\n"
