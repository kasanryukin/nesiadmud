His beard,\r\nonce coal-black, has gone to silver and is braided into a precise, judicial \r\nknot bound by steel clasps.  His polished armor bears the insignia of the \r\nBalanced Scale upon the breastplate, its ceremonial etchings filled with dark \r\nenamel rather than gold.  Upon his brow rests a corolla of tempered iron, inset\r\nwith a square-cut garnet that signifies his station as magistrate.  Though his \r\neyes are grayed by age, their sharpness betrays nothing; they measure as surely\r\nas any balance he keeps.\r\n\r\nWhen he speaks, his voice is low and deliberate, each word weighed as though \r\nrendered into law.  There is neither warmth nor cruelty in his tone, only an \r\nunwavering sense of equity.  His desk is rarely without petitioners, and those \r\nwho come before him quickly learn that mercy and justice, in his view, are not \r\nalways the same.\r\n"
