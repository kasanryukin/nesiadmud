## Hello from NesiaMUD
Welcome to the NesiaMUD project!  This started as a way to learn python in an environment I'm comfortable with (I one was one of Geoff's later contributors around 2007-2010, mostly helping with getting it running for people through the old yahoogroup. RIP Geoff.) I'm not censoring out my world data so you can see the world as it develops if you so choose.  Will this project ever become a publicly accessible MUD? Who knows!

I'm primarily a writer, not a programmer, so the world aspect is something I'm passionate about.  I have a little over 300 pages of notes, snippets, short stores, and other lore things I'm developing, so while I'm learning python by programming a game, I'm really learning python to build an interactive world.  And of course I want to have fun in this world, so a lot of the programming direction is heavily inspired by MUDs of yore ranging from Gemstone II all the way to modern projects like [Coffeemud](https://github.com/bozimmerman/CoffeeMud).

Want to contribute? Open an issue about what you'd like to add or work on and I'll give it a consider. I have SOME experience on multi-developer projects (I contribute to [CDDA](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA)), but I've never lead a project and things might go awry.


## NakedMud 4.1
[NakedMud](https://github.com/NakedMud/nakedmud) Is the foundation upon which Nesia is built. A thank you to **Kevin Morgan (LimpingNinja)** for keeping the project alive and moderizing aspects of it, and a big thank you to the late **Geoff Hollis** for starting the project and for being very approachable in it's infancy.

## NakedMud Direct Contributors

**David Marquardt (Axiom of Ender's Keep)** For the heavy-lift work and support on migrating from Python 2.x to 3+ and continued support in tracking down critical bugs.

**Phil B. Garner** For scaffolding out the combat code which will be released soon as an official module. (Nesia Note: our combat is built in-house heavily influenced by Simutronics games.)

## NakedMud Original Foundations

NakedMud builds upon the excellent work of:

**SocketMud by Brian Graversen** - The original foundation that handled all the complex socket programming, allowing NakedMud to focus on the fun stuff. As Brian wrote: *"Little mud project, which has a command interpreter and supports ANSI colors... has a nifty little help file system, and a few commands (say, quit, who, etc). Also supports MCCP version 1 and 2."*

**Code Snippets by Erwin Andreasen** - Various utility functions and improvements that made their way into SocketMud and subsequently into NakedMud.

We maintain these credits not just out of courtesy, but because NakedMud's success stands on the shoulders of these generous developers who shared their work with the community.

*Welcome to NakedMud! Whether you're here to build your first MUD or add features to an existing one, we're excited to see what you'll create. The only limit is your imagination.*

**Happy MUDding!**
